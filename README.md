# Big-Integer-in-Cpp

## Task:
Created a large Integer library, similar to what we have in Java as BigInteger. This library provides functonalites to store arbitrarily large integer and perform basic math operatons.


## Math Operatons implemented:
 1. Fast Exponentation of two Big Integers
 2. GCD of two Big Integers
 3. Factorial of a Big Integer
 4. Multiplication of two Big Integers
 5. Subtraction of two Big Integers
 6. Modulo Division of two Big Integers
